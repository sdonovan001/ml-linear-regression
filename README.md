# TF / Keras ML Linear Regression Example
---
## Overview
TensorFlow is a widely used, open-source machine learning framework developed by Google.  It is primarily used for training and deploying neural networks. Tensorflow offers a flexible and scalable platform for building and running machine learning models.  Keras is a high-level, user-friendly API for building and training deep learning models.  It was initially developed as an independent library but is now tightly integrated into TensorFlow as its official high-level API. Keras simplifies the process of working with neural networks, making it easier to define, train, and evaluate models.

This repo will walk you through training and serving a Linear Regression ML model using Tensorflow and Keras. The model will predict cab fares in the city of chicago.
## Linear Regression Basics
Linear Regression is a very common statistical method that allows us to learn the relationship (or function) from a given set of continuous data (training data). For example, we are given some data points **[(X<sub>1</sub>, Y<sub>1</sub>), (X<sub>2</sub>, Y<sub>2</sub>), ... (X<sub>n</sub>, Y<sub>n</sub>)]** and we need to learn the relationship between them or the function **f(X)** that maps a given value of **X** to its corresponding value of **Y**. In the case of Linear regression, the function is a straight line of the form **f(x) = wX + b** where **w** (the weight) and **b** (the bias) are refered to as the parameters of the model. To determine the values of **w** and **b** that best fit the given data points, we will use a **Gradient Descent** optimizer algorithm.

Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm often used to train machine learning models by locating the minimum values within a loss function. Through an iterative process, gradient descent minimizes the loss function and reduces the difference between predicted and actual results, improving the modelâ€™s accuracy. The three types of gradient descent are batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent and mini-batch gradient descent. We will be using the mini-batch gradient descent in our example.  This may sound a bit *"MATHY"* right now but walking through the example will help clarify your understanding.
## Setup Environment
We are going to use conda for model training and Docker Desktop for model serving.  Instructions for setting up a conda environment can be found below and Docker Desktop installation instructions can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/).
```
# If you don't already have conda installed... install miniconda
# The steps outlined below are for a Mac with Apple silicon
mkdir -p ~/miniconda3
curl https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.sh -o ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
bash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3
rm ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
export PATH=~/miniconda3/condabin:$PATH
conda init
# Don't forget to exit and restart shell

# Create a new conda env
conda create --name keras python=3.11

# Install python dependencies
conda activate keras
conda install keras pandas scikit-learn plotly seaborn tensorflow -y
```
## Basic ML Pipeline
A machine learning (ML) pipeline is a series of interconnected steps that streamline the process of building, training, evaluating, and deploying ML models, from data ingestion to model deployment and monitoring.  We will walk you through the steps outlined in the diagram below.
